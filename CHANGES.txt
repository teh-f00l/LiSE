== 0.9 | DATE HERE ==
This release is for ProcJam 2018.

* Changed license to AGPL3+, but also waive rights in case of my death.
* Switched to semantic versioning.
* Made the frontend experience faster by implementing deltas. Use Engine.get_delta(...) to rapidly generate a dictionary describing changes between two points in time in a single branch.
* Switched serialization format from an abuse of JSON to msgpack.
* Improved the API of the ELiDE widgets, making it easier to use them in your own game. See https://github.com/LogicalDash/DungeonUniversity for an example.
* You can zoom the map with the mousewheel now.
* Reduced memory usage for large worlds. They still take a long time to load; I'll work on that.
* Wrote a real tutorial for building LiSE games in Python outside of ELiDE.
* Made the order of execution for rulebooks easier to understand. Basically, rulebooks are followed in alphabetical order; rules within them go in whatever order they were added.
* Rearranged the UI a little.
* You can edit every rulebook in ELiDE now, including the ones that apply to all a character's avatars and so forth.
* Rules will only be followed for entities that still exist when they're run.
* The turn will always increment *before* running any rules, and no rules will be run on turn 0.
* Various little performance improvements and fixes to things like data integrity.


== Alpha 8 | 2017-10-06 ==
This release is for ProcJam 2017.

* Made the time model more granular. What was formerly called a tick is now a turn, which contains as many ticks as you need.
* Support a rudimentary form of dialog menu for player interaction.
* Rules and rulebooks are now journaled, and may change throughout the game.
* Python source code is no longer stored in SQLite--just plain text files.
* Changed the rule API so that rule functions are only ever called with a single argument, the entity that they apply to.
* ELiDE is now a pure Python module.
* Performance improvements.


=== Alpha 7 | 2017-05-06 ===
* Restructure everything in LiSE around a new caching strategy.
* Generally cleaner UI.
* If all your places are named with pairs of integers, you get automatic grid layout in ELiDE.


=== Alpha 6 | 2016-02-01 ===
* Opening a functions editor no longer crashes the app.
* All the function editors are now in tabs of one screen.
* Nicer auto layout of spots.
* Various smaller fixes.


=== Alpha 5 | 2016-01-03 ===
* A whole new approach to interprocess communication resulting in much more acceptable performance within ELiDE.
* LiSE caches the whole world state.
* ELiDE has a new caching scheme as well. This is invisible to the user but rules out some aliasing bugs.
* Fixed some rules not being polled.
* A new example, college.py, and some fixes to kobold.py where it hadn't kept up with API changes.
* The first sprouts of a world generation API, currently undocumented since I myself don't know how to work with it. Observe its methods within the class AbstractCharacter in the LiSE.character module. Chain the methods together and play around with the order to the best effect.
* Lots of refactoring.
* Some new graphics from Marsh Davies for Procjam 2015. And it's easier to include your own now, with an atlas and a change in elide.ini (though undocumented).
* Real version numbers in the Python packages.


=== Alpha 4 | 2015-08-26 ===
* The rules editor is now usable under normal conditions. After you've made Actions and Triggers, check this out by selecting something and pressing the Rules button.
* The big > button will cause time to pass for so long as it is toggled, as it was always meant to.
* Improvements to input handling and collision detection.
* Less cryptic README.
* Crash fixes.


=== Alpha 3 | 2015-08-11 ===
* Performance improvements.
* Architectural changes in ELiDE.
* Many crash bugs fixed.
* Pop-over windows changed into Screens, making them tidier and enabling transition animations that aren't much to look at presently.
* Thing and Place graphics can now be added in the elide.ini configuration file.


=== Alpha 2 | 2015-03-29 ===
* The core LiSE simulation process and the ELiDE graphical frontend are now running in separate processes.
* Fixed some UI interactions.


=== Alpha 1 | 2015-03-06 ===
* Initial release.
